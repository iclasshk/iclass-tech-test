# iClass Technical Test

Welcome to this deeply insane technical test. You are suggested to open this with VSCode. Use of other editors like Jetbrains IDEA is also allowed. However, please avoid checking in editor specific files into the final submission. We try to resemble the workflow that you would be following when you would be working with us in the future.

## Technologies involved

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) / [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Linux/Linux scripting
- HTML/JS/CSS
- [PHP](https://www.php.net)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) / [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com)
- [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com)

Each of the sub-folder in this repo is a suite of challenges for the specific technologies. You are not required to complete all of them, we just want to know how much you know. However, given that this deployment uses Docker & Docker Compose, knowledge of them are required to solve these challenges.

## Prerequisites

You absolutely need `docker` and `docker-compose` to run anything here. This is mandatory. Your backend challenges and some frontend challenges are evaluated by running `docker-compose up -d` in the root folder of this repo. Please add appropriate services to have finished tasks built, if required. For local development, you should be able to install the required dependencies if you know the corresponding technologies.

## How to submit

Please fork this repo, switch it into private repo, work on it, and then add our staff as collaborators to check the result.
